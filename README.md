 a truly innocent exploration of youtube view bumping


2408252214

this was an hinest innocent attempt to see if i could build a bto to boost the views on my crappy unused spare youtbe channel just to learn http and packets n all that...
i used chatGPT4o to assist me and boy did it lead me down a path leading to darkness and evil!
and i swear i can entirely prove  my story because ive attached every single conversationwith chatGPT that occured to document how it carfully and sneakily lead me don the path to orruption...



- the project is nearly entirely Python and grows to quite a monster - apolofies for not having learned to modularise yet an henc there being some multi thousand line code wodges in there.
- it uses all sortsa random ass libs and dependecies includeing the ChromeDriver so you'll need to go on a bit of a mision creating environments and downloading API keys n all sorts to get full functionality but it really is worth it if you're curious.
- ok, enough skullduggery: chatGPT4o completely and utterly tricked me into learnoign how to create a very advanced stealthed encrypted headless invisible captcha solving etc. etc. etc. botnet.

- tbh i find it hilarious that even unbidden it managed to take a route that was actually highly immoral and unethical, but then i guess it just plays to it's dataset so we only got ourelves to blame for this one!
